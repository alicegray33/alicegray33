# Makers Software Developmet Bootcamp

This is a list of the projects I worked on during my 10 week software development bootcamp by Makers. I have collated this list to demonstrate my progress through th course, however due to the nature of the course may of these projects are incomplete. Its my intention to ensure each one has a Readme that reflects how far I got and what the project was about. Please also note that some of these were solo projects, some were pairing projects and some where group projects.
