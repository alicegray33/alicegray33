- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alice. I'm on a DevOps Apprenticeship being run by Makers. Part of this involves completing a [Software Development Bootcamp](/Makers.md) for 10 weeks, followed by 8 weeks on a DevOps Bootcamp. Its then followed by a placement with an employer.

- ðŸ‘€ In college I learned a bit of Visual Basic. I also taught myself HTML, Perl and PHP; and made websites as a hobby. I also taught myself a little bit of C and Java. That was all a long time ago now, and I haven't done much coding since. But now Iâ€™m interested to learn more coding, and more about the DevOps role.

- ðŸŒ± So far I've learned some Ruby and some Python  as part of the Makers apprenticeship and really enjoying it!

- ðŸ“« The best way to reach me is by email. Stick my github username in front of @gmail.com and click send!
